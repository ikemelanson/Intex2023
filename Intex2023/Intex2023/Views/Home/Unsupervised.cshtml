                <h2>About the model</h2>
                <p>
                    How to read the graph:<br /> <br />

                    Keep in mind that this graph was scaled so that there is no skewness in the data. If this data was not scaled then that would translate to
                    an in accuracte model. So currently all data points are on the same scale.

                    <br /><br />Depth is shown on a scale from -2 to 3. 3 being the deepest that a person was buried and -2 being the closest to the surface someone was buried.
                    <br />
                    <br />Length is on a scale of -2 to 1.5. For this, length is the height of the mummy and -2 would be the shortest mummy length and 1.5 would be the tallest.<br />

                    <br />headdirection_W is on a scale of -2.5 to 0. This represent a boolean of true or false. So all the data points closest to 0 represent the individual
                    being buried with their head facing West. So on the contrary, all the data points closest to -2.5 would be facing East.<br />
                    <br />
                    Here are some things that can be predicted from the model. This model relates to the supervised model about predicting head direction.
                    Based on what is seen in the data, a lot of the individuals were buried with their head facing east. It was a lot more common
                    in the newer generations to be buried with the head facing east. Due to inadequate data to determine whether the individual was a male or a female
                    we cannot draw any correlations to whether or not gender has any significant role in the direction of the head. From what is shown, the only strong
                    correlations that can be gathered is between depth and the direction of the head.
